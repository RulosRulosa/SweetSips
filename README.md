<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

People with a great love for coffee do not have a community where users can share, discover, and learn about different methods and recipes for coffee, or recommend coffee places that sell certain types of coffee beans, that's why "SweetSips" was created. It's an application designed to create a community around coffee.

The app aims to help coffee enthusiasts by allowing them to share their experiences through articles/reviews of visited coffee places. It also aims to provide personalized coffee shop recommendations to the user, display routes to coffee shops, and showcase different brewing methods and recipes. These and other functionalities are the support that 'SweetSips' seeks to provide to all users looking for an exciting way to enjoy coffee and explore new coffee experiences.

With these insights, we can now move forward to creating wireframes for our project. Wireframes will help us visualize the structure and layout of our product, ensuring that we effectively address user needs and provide an intuitive user experience.

Following the wireframes, we will develop mockups to present a more detailed and polished representation of the final product. Mockups will help us refine the visual design and user interface, making sure that the product is both aesthetically pleasing and functional before moving on to development.
